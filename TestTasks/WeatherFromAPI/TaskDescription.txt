Implement WeatherManager.CompareWeather

This task is based on https://openweathermap.org open API. It does require registration and a key (which you get after registration), but it is completely free.
Pay attention that key for an account may activate up to an hour. 

Pay attention:
	1) Free API provides up to 60 calls a minute. All further calls will be blocked until the end of the minute (and if too much further tries are made - an account will be blocked)
		=> Just in case, check for 'Too many calls response' (See https://openweathermap.org/appid)
	2) '5 day / 3 hour forecast data' should be used (it should be free). - https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
	   Unfortunately, it supports only latitude/longitude specification, but there is a 'Geocoding API' (also free) to get latitude/longitude by city name: https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api

Requirements:
	1) CompareWeather gets fully specified city names such as 'kyiv,ua' as an input and a number of days less or equal to 5.
	   Number of days shows how many days starting from today (day 1) should be included in comparison.
	   E.g. dayCount = 2 => today, tomorrow are included
	   Non-existing cities should result in an ArgumentException. Any non-valid number of days should result in an ArgumentException.
	   If the city name is not fully specified - use first city in the list returned by 'Geocoding API'
	2) Pay attention that data returned by API is for every 3 hours, not 1 data point for each day
	3) How to count WarmerDaysCount: days where average of all provided hourly temperatures in CityA is higher than in CityB.
	4) How to count RainierDaysCount: days where sum of all provided hourly rain volume in CityA is higher than in CityB.
	5) Please add unit tests for this task.
